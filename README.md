# Ars Kali: Glitches
Pinta add-ins for the truly insane. This pack is about glitch effects.
#### For the truly insane?
Me! I'm mostly porting effects and plugins that have kept me tethered to certain other image editors on Windows. There's no real pattern to what I'm adding besides me using it regularly in my art.

Documentation is scarce (and this is my first shot at doing anything in C#) but as these circumstances improve hopefully the quantity and quality of the effects will as well.

#### What effects are included?
##### Stylize > Chromatic Aberration
Shifts the red, green, and blue channels of an image to specified points.
##### Render > Scanlines
Renders scanlines without the CRT filter.
