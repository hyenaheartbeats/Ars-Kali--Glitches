Pinta add-ins for the truly insane. This pack is about glitch effects.

#### For the truly insane?
Me! I'm mostly porting effects and plugins that have kept me tethered to certain other image editors on Windows. There's no real pattern to what I'm adding besides me using it regularly in my art.

Documentation is scarce (and this is my first shot at doing anything in C#) but as these circumstances improve hopefully the quantity and quality of the effects will as well.

#### What effects are included?
##### Stylize > Chromatic Aberration
<img width=65% height=65% src="https://hyena.icu/demoimages/arsglitches/glitcheschromaticaberration.png">
Shifts the red, green, and blue channels of an image to specified points.

##### Render > Scanlines
<img width=65% height=65% src="https://hyena.icu/demoimages/arsglitches/glitchesscanlines.png">
Renders out scanlines and interlace lines.

##### Render > Colored Artifacts
<img width=65% height=65% src="https://hyena.icu/demoimages/arsglitches/glitchesartifacts.png">
Adds randomly colored and sized rectangles, to be used with other effects and blending modes.

##### Distort > Pixel Drag
<img width=65% height=65% src="https://hyena.icu/demoimages/arsglitches/glitchesdrag.png">
Selects random pixels and drags them with configurable axis and distance.

##### Distort > Row Slice
<img width=65% height=65% src="https://hyena.icu/demoimages/arsglitches/glitchesrowslice.png">
Chops and shifts segments of the image along the horizontal axis.

##### Noise > Adjustment Noise
<img width=65% height=65% src="https://hyena.icu/demoimages/arsglitches/glitchesnoise.png">
Randomly adjusts the color values of each pixel (plus or minus up to 16). This produces a grainy effect.
