# Ars Kali: Glitches
Pinta add-ins for the truly insane. This pack is about glitch effects.
#### For the truly insane?
Me! I'm mostly porting effects and plugins that have kept me tethered to certain other image editors on Windows. There's no real pattern to what I'm adding besides me using it regularly in my art.

Documentation is scarce (and this is my first shot at doing anything in C#) but as these circumstances improve hopefully the quantity and quality of the effects will as well.

#### What effects are included?
##### Stylize > Chromatic Aberration
Shifts the red, green, and blue channels of an image to specified points.
##### Render > Scanlines
Renders out scanlines and interlace lines.
##### Render > Colored Artifacts
Adds randomly colored and sized rectangles, to be used with other effects and blending modes.
##### Distort > Random Byte Overwrite
Overwrites sections of the image with random junk data until the image breaks.
##### Distort > Pixel Drag
Selects random pixels and drags them with configurable axis and distance.
##### Distort > Row Slice
Chops and shifts segments of the image along the horizontal axis.
##### Noise > Adjustment Noise
Randomly adjusts the color values of each pixel (plus or minus up to 16). This produces a grainy effect.
